## Version Notice

> **Version Notice**: This mod is actively developed and tested only for the **latest version** of My Dystopian Robot Girlfriend. Using it with older game versions may result in bugs or crashes.

> This mod is ONLY supported on Windows and Linux officialy. I do not give support for **Lemonloader**/Android not working.

> This mod is only compatible with MDRG 0.95 and onwards. 0.90 and below is **NOT** supported.

## Overview

Audio and expression mod for *My Dystopian Robot Girlfriend* with dynamic moaning based on pleasure and breathing.

> Important note: You need to have played through the prologue, in the prologue, moaning is disabled.
> Directly after the prologue you may notice that Jun doesn't moan as often as for example in my showcase video. Thats due to the this mod adjusting to how much she likes you, and how attracted she is to you. So she will moan more as you play the game more.

## Features

* **Pleasure-Based Responsiveness** - Moans trigger based on pleasure changes. Higher pleasure makes her more reactive, while lower pleasure requires larger changes. Sensitivity adjusts automatically throughout the scene.
* **Moan Clustering** - Moans build naturally into clusters. The first moan often leads to more, but each additional moan becomes less likely. Creates organic escalation instead of constant noise.
* **Intelligent Breathing** - Breathing becomes more frequent during intense scenes. Light activity rarely triggers breathing, but heavy moaning leads to natural breathing between sounds.
* **Dynamic Moan Frequency** - Moan speed depends on in-game stats. Higher lust and sympathy make her respond more frequently. Lower stats produce slower, more spaced-out moans.
* **Dynamic Expressions** - Sex moans adjust her facial expressions for more engaging scenes.
* **Audio Variety** - The mod prevents the same sound from repeating over and over by cycling through clips. Previous sounds need time before they can play again.
* **Moan States** - Different sounds for while-sex moans, cumming start (single startup moan), cumming ongoing, and cumming end (conclusion moan after cumming stops).

## Installation

### What you need:

* MelonLoader: [LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases)
* Mods.zip from [IkariDevGIT/MDRGMoanMod/releases](https://github.com/IkariDevGIT/MDRGMoanMod/releases)

> Note: MAKE SURE to get the correct version, the version listed in the release (via "Compatible MDRG versions") needs to match up your MDRG Game version.

### Steps:

1. Download the game (If not already downloaded)

2. Get MelonLoader set up:

   * Download MelonLoader from the link above
   * Press "Add game manually"
   * Find and select the game's .exe file
   * Click on the game in the selection menu
   * DO NOT enable "nightly builds". Install the MelonLoader version "0.7.2".
   * Hit install

3. First launch:

   * Open the game once (this creates the necessary folders)

4. Install the mod:

   * Extract the contents of Mods.zip directly into the `/Mods/` folder
   * Make sure the files are placed correctly: `/Mods/MoanMod.dll` and `/Mods/MoanMod/...`
   * Don't put them in a subfolder like `/Mods/Mods/`

### Expected folder structure:

```
Game Install Folder/

        └── breath/
```

> **Important**: Make sure your game installation path **does not contain non-Latin characters** (for example Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese, etc.).  
> Install the game in a folder with only standard English letters (e.g. `C:\Games\MDRG`). Otherwise the mod may not work.
